                    for EPIC go live, work on the WAN cutovers, and migrate existing hardware to aspirus's domain.</p>

             <p class="pt-2">During the discovery stage My first task was to come up with a
                  timeline for completing the on-site walkthrough and discovery. My fellow contractors and I deliberated and provided a acceptable timeline for completion.
                    While awaiting the timeline's approval we were provided maps of the locations I noticed that they included room numbers and suggested that we all
                    add the room numbers to location based spreadsheets so that while on-site we could be sure that we visited every room. Shortly after 
                    our timeline was approved by both companies we started our walkthrough.

                   My Role during this phase to inventory all the End host devices, peripherals, and speciality software. Other Members of the team gathered
                    the information on the MFDs, phones, and documented locations on the maps.</p>

A design system provides a framework for designers and developers to work more efficiently and effectively by providing a shared vocabulary and set of tools.</p>
               <p>Our design system includes a comprehensive set of guidelines, reusable UI components, and design patterns. These guidelines ensure consistency across all our products and help us deliver high-quality designs faster.
