              <h1>Project North Woods</h1>
              <p>Project North Woods was the technical discovery and integration of the seven Ascension hospitals and their surrounding twenty-three clinics into
                  the Aspirus Health Care system.</p>
              <h2>Business Need</h2>
              <p>Aspirus Inc. hired me as a contractor to work on the discovery of the Ascension computer systems, setup the required hardware and software
                    for EPIC go live, work on the WAN cutovers, and migrate existing hardware to aspirus's domain.</p>

             <p class="pt-2">During the discovery stage My first task was to come up with a
                  timeline for completing the on-site walkthrough and discovery. My fellow contractors and I deliberated and provided a acceptable timeline for completion.
                    While awaiting the timeline's approval we were provided maps of the locations I noticed that they included room numbers and suggested that we all
                    add the room numbers to location based spreadsheets so that while on-site we could be sure that we visited every room. Shortly after 
                    our timeline was approved by both companies we started our walkthrough. 
            </br></br>
                   My Role during this phase to inventory all the End host devices, peripherals, and speciality software. Other Members of the team gathered
                    the information on the MFDs, phones, and documented locations on the maps.</p>
